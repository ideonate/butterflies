# Butterfly Classification using Innotater Jupyter Widget

The Jupyter Notebooks numbered 1-5 in this repo show how to use the [Innotater Jupyter Widget](https://github.com/ideonate/jupyter-innotater) to manually filter training data and draw bounding boxes on images.

It shows how to train a simple butterfly species classifier first, and then use bounding boxes drawn manually to create a combined model which 'zooms in' on the area of the image containing the butterfly first before training the classifier from there.
